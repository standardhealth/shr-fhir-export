[Q1]   F2URL extensions on backbone elements?
[Q2]   F2F mappings onto backbone elements?
[Q3,6] If F2F mapping refers to option in choice, do we constrain out other choices?
       YES
[Q4]   Confirm: If mapping doesn't work on direct path, try the value

[Q5]   What do we do with all non-value fields when mapping a value?
[Q7]   Do we add extension for all unmapped branches of the tree?  If so, how/where?
       Try to be smart... look at what is mapped and its parent...
[Q8]   How should we turn unmapped primitives into an extension?
       - sub extension named value
[Q9]   Should we allow choices of codes w/ different value sets or require new VS be made?
       - need to make grouping value set
[Q10]  Language
       - if value is code, can't map to Practitioner.communication (CodeableConcept)
       - if value is CodeableConcept, can't map to DomainResource.language (code)
       - map CodeableConcept to code

[T1]   F2F: Navigate through FHIR references
[T2]   Adjust to support allowable "conversions"
[T3]   Add fixed value constraints
[T4]   Apply constraints to extensions
[T5]   Add support for choice fields when creating extensions
[T6]   Move logic that adds root extension element to more logical place
[T7]   Should we drill into choices when trying to get a specific snapshot element (see context)
[T8]   Do our quantity constraints work?
