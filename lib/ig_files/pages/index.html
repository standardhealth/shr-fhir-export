      <h2>Standard Health Record Implementation Guide (IG)</h2>
      <p>
        The Standard Health Record (SHR) provides a high quality, computable source of patient information by
        establishing a single target for health data standardization. The SHR is foundational, dealing first with the
        reliable and repeatable collection and aggregation of a wide range of patient-focused data. Through the SHR, we
        realize greater transparency, empowerment, and clinical interoperability that supports patients, caregivers,
        clinicians, researchers, scientists, and public health organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enabled through open source technology, the SHR is designed by, and for, its users to support communication
        across homes and healthcare systems. The SHR enables organizations, and the American public, to realize the
        benefits of improved care communication and coordination, reductions in medical error, less waste, fraud, and
        abuse, enhanced information sharing, and the decreased costs that accompany a large-scale focus on prevention.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Implementation Guide defines FHIR profiles, extensions, value sets, and code systems necessary to exchange
        SHR elements using FHIR 1.8 (STU3 January Ballot). Many elements and fields in SHR do not have direct
        equivalents in FHIR. Where possible, SHR element fields have been mapped to existing FHIR properties. When it is
        not possible to map a field to a property, an extension is defined. In the spirit of re-usability, extensions
        are defined globally and referenced wherever they are needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the <a href="http://standardhealthrecord.org/shr/">SHR Specification
        <img style="text-align: baseline" src="external.png" /></a> for the original definitions of all SHR elements.
