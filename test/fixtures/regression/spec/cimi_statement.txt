Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.statement
Description:	"The namespace containing cimi-derived classes representing complete clinical statements. In this specification, these classes derive from the StatementTopic class hierarchy, not ClinicalStatement, which is a significant departure from CIMI. This simplifies the resulting logical models."
Uses:			shr.core, cimi

Element:		EvaluationResultRecorded
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Represents the result of evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) that have been performed.

EvaluationResultRecorded has a value representing the result (answer), or an ExceptionValue indicating why the value is not present. The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments."
				StatementTopic is type EvaluationResultTopic
				StatementContext is type RecordedContext
0..1			Members

		Element:		Members
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Members represent the elements of a group of a related but independent evaluations. 
		
		Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent evaluation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual findings that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself. Although the proper place to define Members this might be in EvaluationResultTopic, it cannot be defined there because the value references EvaluationResultRecorded, which is a clinical statement class.
		
		CIMI Alignment: CIMI V0.0.4 does not have this attribute and uses CompoundClinicalStatement to create panels. Compared to having a separate class, the current representation closer alignment with FHIR and greater flexibility (related observations can be added to any observation)."

Element:		LaboratoryTestResultRecorded
Based on:		EvaluationResultRecorded
Description:	"Measurement resulting from a laboratory analysis. The category is fixed to 'laboratory' to align with US-Core."
0..*			DiagnosticService
				EvaluationResultTopic.Category is OBSCAT#laboratory

		Element:		DiagnosticService
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This is used for searching, sorting and display purposes."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from DiagnosticServiceVS if covered

		
	
Element:		SimplifiedLaboratoryTestResultRecorded
Based on:		LaboratoryTestResultRecorded
Description:	"The usual case for a test result from a pathology lab, based on a specimen taken from a patient. Note that the body site is not explicit here; it is part of the specimen resource associated with the lab result."

Element:		ConditionPresenceStatement
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A condition that is or may be present in a subject. 'Condition' is interpreted broadly and could be a disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, worry, or trouble.

In CIMI terms, it is an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines a ConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext context. The core attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included here because of mapping difficulties to FHIR DomainResource."
			StatementTopic is type ConditionTopic
			StatementContext is type ConditionPresenceContext
0..1		Stage
			
			Element:		Stage
			Concept:		MTH#C0699749
			Description:	"The relative advancement in the course of a disease. The value is the summary stage or stage group. StageDetail optionally contains the full staging information.
			
			This attribute does not have a direct analogy in CIMI V0.0.4 (the closest being ConditionAssertion.diseasePhase), but is included here for consistency with FHIR and because staging is important in the context of breast cancer and cancer in general."
			Value:			CodeableConcept
			0..1			StageDetail
			
					Element:		StageDetail
					Concept:		TBD
					Description:	"The full staging information"
