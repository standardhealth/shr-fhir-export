Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.\n\nCIMI Alignment:\n1) In CIMI  V0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, where specimen is 0..1. The cardinality of Specimen has been changed to 0..1 to enable FHIR mapping.\n2) In CIMI V0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related ('has-member') observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model. CompoundClinicalStatement has not been used to represent panel-like findings, because of the complexity of mapping this class to FHIR.\n3) In CIMI V0.0.4, allowable datatypes for result (aka Value) include EmbeddedContent,  GpsLocation,  Multimedia,  ParsableContent, and other types not allowed in a FHIR Observation. To make mapping feasible, the types of Value were restricted to only the allowable FHIR datatypes.\n4) ExceptionValue has been moved to the RecordedContext, because it is only relevant when a value is supposed to be recorded, but is not.\n5) The cardinality of FindingMethod has been changed from 0..* to 0..1 to make it possible to map to FHIR, where Observation.method is 0..1.\n6) The class PhysicalEvaluationResult has been united with this class, and the body location (AnatomicalLocation) has been added to this class. This is because bodySite is part of Observation, and it cannot be profiled out of EvaluationResult and then re-included in PhysicalEvaluationResult.\n7) The cardinality of AnatomicalLocation has been changed from 0..* to 0..1 to make it possible to map to FHIR, where Observation.bodySite is 0..1.\n8) The attribute evaluationDate has been moved to RecordedContext, because it only applies to evaluations that have been done.\n9) The attributes device and evaluationProcedure have been removed for brevity, since they are not used in the current IG.",

The cardinality of Specimen has been changed to 0..1 to enable FHIR mapping.\n2) In CIMI V0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related ('has-member') observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model. CompoundClinicalStatement has not been used to represent panel-like findings, because of the complexity of mapping this class to FHIR.\n3) In CIMI V0.0.4, allowable datatypes for result (aka Value) include EmbeddedContent,  GpsLocation,  Multimedia,  ParsableContent, and other types not allowed in a FHIR Observation. To make mapping feasible, the types of Value were restricted to only the allowable FHIR datatypes.\n4) ExceptionValue has been moved to the RecordedContext, because it is only relevant when a value is supposed to be recorded, but is not.\n5) The cardinality of FindingMethod has been changed from 0..* to 0..1 to make it possible to map to FHIR, where Observation.method is 0..1.\n6) The class PhysicalEvaluationResult has been united with this class, and the body location (AnatomicalLocation) has been added to this class. This is because bodySite is part of Observation, and it cannot be profiled out of EvaluationResult and then re-included in PhysicalEvaluationResult.\n7) The cardinality of AnatomicalLocation has been changed from 0..* to 0..1 to make it possible to map to FHIR, where Observation.bodySite is 0..1.\n8) The attribute evaluationDate has been moved to RecordedContext, because it only applies to evaluations that have been done.\n9) The attributes device and evaluationProcedure have been removed for brevity, since they are not used in the current IG.",
